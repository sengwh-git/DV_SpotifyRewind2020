# DV_SpotifyRewind2020

### Introduction 

In these recent years, Spotify has made its name in the world of entertainment, especially for the music industry as of the downtrend of the physical CDs and the uptrend of technology. It is easy to get a taste of our favourite artists' latest hits immediately from the palm of your hand using mobile phones or even a laptop. In recent years, Spotify has been made knowingly to conclude personal statistics for each of the users personally, which describes the most streamed artists for the users and so on. Through the charts data from Spotify, we would like to understand which artist and what songs make the most impact throughout different regions in 2020.

The data source is from [Spotify Official Charts](https://spotifycharts.com/regional/), where it is open-source data from Spotify that provides charts across regions with Spotify streaming service in a comma-separated values (CSV) format. The service offers several charts including Top 200 songs with the most streams or Hot 50 streams, daily or weekly. The data that we have queried is of the year 2020 on a daily interval, which includes information about the number of streams, the ranking of music across the available regions through a python library called [Fycharts](https://github.com/kelvingakuo/fycharts) that a fully-fledged installable python package for extracting the top 200 and viral 50 charts off of [Spotify Official Charts](https://spotifycharts.com/regional/).
